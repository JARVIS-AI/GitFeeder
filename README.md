Here’s a **ready‑to‑use template** you can drop into your repo and tweak with your project details.

Jarvis, if you want, I can also **add GitHub shields/badges** for:
- GitHub stars
- Last commit
- License
- Vercel status  

That will make your README pop visually and look even more “developer program” ready.  

Do you want me to add those badges for you?
